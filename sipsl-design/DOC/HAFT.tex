\section{Overview}

\subsection{comments}
Split the SIPSL between SUDP and SIPENGINE (or between SIPENGINE and SL_CC) to
have one frontend tier to receive calls and more backend tiers to handle the
logic. The backend tiers can be spread on different nodes or colocated.
I need to decide how messages are sent to the backtier, shared memory or tcp.

\subsection{Design}
The fronend tier supportst the SUDP and the SIPENGINE. The sip message creted by
the SIPENGINE is encapsulated into the MESSAGE. The message must be passed to
one backend tier.

The frontend tier must decide to which backend tier to send the message. If the
message is new then it will choose following some criteria. If the transaction
is in progress the fronend must send the message to the correct backend.
Frontend must keep a map of CALL-ID and backend id.

Moving the message:

\begin{enumerate}
        \item Corba 
        \item Shared Memory
\end{enumerate}
